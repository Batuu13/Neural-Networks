Parameterized Neural Network Implementation

This project is a simple parameterized neural network implementation. I used this for my Machine Learning Class. 




** Dataset **
• MNIST dataset http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ contains handwritten digits and
corresponding labels. Dataset contains 60000 training and 10000 test images.
• Dataset and the code to load it are provided to you. You can donwload them from ftp:
//cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/pub/dersler/BBM4XX/BBM409_ML/Assignment_3/load/. The
dataset is split into three sets: Training (50000 images), test (10000 images)and validation
(10000 images). You can use validation set for training (50000+10000 images).
• When you load the dataset, you’ll see that every image is represented with [784x1]
vector and has a label. You’ll use the given representation (do not have to extract new
features).
